# Single Header C++

A (small) collection of C++ single header libraries written by me. All are licensed under the ISC license, allowing use of any kind as long as credit is given. For other single header libs check out [Nothing's list](https://github.com/nothings/single_file_libs)

### The list
* [elf.hpp](/elf.hpp) - A simple parser for ELF files. Contains parsing for the ELF header, program headers and section headers. Also supports parsing the symbol table and looking up symbols by name using both the initial and GNU hash sections.
